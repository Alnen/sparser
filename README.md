# sparser

A framework that implements raw filtering for faster analytics over raw data.

See the `demo-repl` directory for a brief example. To run it:

1. Build `json/rapidjson` (see the instructions there on how to do that)
2. `make` in the `demo-repl` directory.

Sparser itself is just a header file and only depends on standard C libraries available
on most systems.
